			<h1>About Me:</h1>
			<center><img src="css/casual.JPG" width = "50%"></center>
			<p class = "descr" style = "text-align: left">	Hello! My name is Christian Villegas and I am a Senior at the University of Pennsylvania. I am currently pursuing a double major in both Computer Science and Cognitive Science with a focus in Cognition as Computation. My primary coding languages are Java and Python, however I do have some experience working with Swift, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and enjoy making my projects come to life. I love making apps and working with data as well as working collaboratively with teams to accomplish goals.</p>
			<p class = "descr"> At school I am very active in several organizations such as the Penn Computer Science Society (Penn CSS) where I am on the Hacking and Learning Committee and First Generation Low Income in Tech and Engineering (FLITE) where I am on both the Web-Dev and Content Committee. In both organizations I work to put together events for students who want to learn more about the professional and technical aspects of computer science. I want to share my passion for computer science and to make sure that every student has the opportunity and resources to learn about the field.</p>
			<p class = "descr">	Outside of work, I enjoy running, swimming, basketball (GO LAKERS!), photography, skating, and playing guitar. I am also passionate about productivity and becoming my best self. I love horror books, and have recently challenged myself to watch a lot of critically aclaimed movies (my favorite so far is Whiplash).</p>
